#summary Usage instructions and examples for Really Simple History

*These instructions are for 0.6 RC1. For deployment of 0.4, see the [ReleaseNotesVersionZeroPointFour release notes] for that version.*

= How to deploy Really Simple History =

  * Always deploy RSH from a local or remote web server. It will not function properly from a file: URL on your workstation - especially in IE. This is true of lots of DHTML applications, but especially true of RSH.

  * Always call dhtmlHistory.initialize() and dhtmlHistory.addListener() from within a window.onload event. *RSH will break, especially in IE, if you try to initialize it from any flavor of DOMContentLoaded.* IE doesn't load up its saved cross-session form values until just after the body.onload event, so DOMContentLoaded is not an appropriate event for the initialization of RSH.

  * Always include blank.html in your RSH deployment. The library will simply not work without it. It is recommended that you serve blank.html from the same directory as rsh.js; otherwise you'd have to modify the library's source code.

  * RSH ships with a default JSON parser (json2007.js) that adds methods to Object.prototype, Function.prototype, Array.prototype and other core JS objects. For users who would prefer a less intrusive set of JSON utilities, swap in json2005.js - an optional, alternative library that's also included - and deploy using the instructions below.

  * Users of Prototype, jQuery and other Ajax libraries may leave out both JSON parsers and use the JSON utilities from their own libraries instead. Again, see deployment instructions below.

  * No need to include rshTestPage.html or rshTestPageTop100.opml, which merely provide a test suite for you to play with.

  * If your supported browser list differs from RSH's, you should perform browser detection in your own code. RSH does nothing to disable itself in any browser.
