== Changelog ==

=== 0.6 RC 1 ===

  *  Rock-solid support of Opera up to 9.5 beta for Mac and PC.
  * Rock-solid support of Safari/Mac from 2.03 through 3.03.
  * Tons of internal refactoring.
  * Two-line initialization of dhtmlHistory and historyStorage (as opposed to the previous two init calls in the library and two more in your code).
  * Support for an optional options bundle in the initialization call to trigger debug mode or override default JSON methods.
  * Compatibility with Prototype thanks to the aforementioned JSON override capability.
  * Additional choice in JSON parsers; we now ship with a default 2007 JSON parser that alters core object prototypes and an older 2005 version that doesn't.
  * Better user-agent sniffing that's more resistant to UA spoofing.
  * Removal of a bug introduced in 0.6 beta that threw an error when you hit a virgin (hashless) page state.
  * Graceful swallowing of errors in non-debug mode.
  * Replacement of equality operators with JSLint-friendly identity operators where appropriate.
  * Cleanup of a little cruft from the 0.4 and 0.6 beta versions.



=== 0.6 Beta ===

  * Added support for IE7
  * Added support for Opera/Mac and Opera/Win
  * Added support for Safari 2/Mac
  * Modernized the JSON parser and moved it to a separate file
  * Provided bridge methods for JSON calls to make it easier to swap out JSON parsers
  * Rebuilt original test pages into a single test page that allows you to peek behind the scenes at hidden, hacked-in DOM elements
  * Refactored many private and public methods for better support of more browsers
  * Changed name of private historyStorage.init method to historyStorage.setup to avoid confucion with dhtmlHistory.initialize
  * Removed unused isInternational() method
  * Removed blocks of deprecated, commented-out code

=== Unsupported ===

=== Browser scenarios that still need to be tested ===
  * Firefox for Red Hat
  * IE7/Vista
  * IE7/XP non-standalone
  * All Mac browsers on Leopard (Opera 9.22/9.5/Safari 2?/Safari 3/Firefox 2)

== Roadmap ==

The current goal is to remedy as many of the above-named issues as possible before the next public release. We're starting to migrate issues from this page into the issue tracker now that the major ones have been tackled.

=== Wishlist features/enhancements ===

  * Provide a minified production version
  * Perform proper garbage collection
  * Document update abilities of the add() method
  * Do less internal branching based on useragent - use functional programming patterns to redeclare methods by browser
  * Make private methods actually private/protected
  * Improve hash parsing logic with regexes
  * Debug page: Add the ability for users to add test cases on the fly in the browser
  * Debug page: improve log-window readability
